README BEFORE PLAYING:

Welcome to my game called Watch Your Step

If the game does not run, press tab before you press <p> , this is an issue with people using mac

Objective of the game is to reach the flag by crossing the path. However, it is not as easy as it looks. The game comprises of four stages where difficulty of the game increases as you cross each red signal. You are not supposed to move until the signal turns green

Press p to play, i to view instructions (m to quit instructions), e to exit the game

Press c to activate cheat code - using this the red traffic signal will not detect your movement and you can easily go across the path to win, however your scores will not be recorded

Press <b> for (Boss Key) a picture of a spreadsheet if someone's watching over your laptop to see if you are working and <q> to quit the boss key picture.

You can always restart the game if you die using <r>

Happy Gaming!
